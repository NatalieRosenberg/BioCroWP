<!--
This file should document all pull requests and all user-visible changes.

When a pull request is completed, changes made should be added to a section at
the top of this file called "# UNRELEASED". All changes should be categorized
under "## MAJOR CHANGES", "## MINOR CHANGES", or "## BUG FIXES" following the
major.minor.patch structure of semantic versioning. When applicable, entries
should include direct links to the relevant pull requests.

Then, when a new release is made, "# UNRELEASED" should be replaced by a heading
with the new version number, such as "# CHANGES IN skelBML VERSION 2.0.0." This
section will combine all of the release notes from all of the pull requests
merged in since the previous release.

Subsequent commits will then include a new "UNRELEASED" section in preparation
for the next release.
